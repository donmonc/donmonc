# Hi, I'm Emeka 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻

I'm a Data Scientist & Machine Learning engineer who is passionate about using analytics to peform magic, contributing to open-source, and building Machine Learning community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Plotly, Seaborn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Python, Gradio, Streamlit, and Flask. In 2020, I was selected to be an inaugural <a href="https://stars.github.com/">GitHub Star 🌟</a> based on my involvement in the tech community.  My interest in the ML ecosystem led me to becoming one of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/React-Ladies/">React Ladies</a>, a community for women and non-binary ReactJS developers.
