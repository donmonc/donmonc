I'm a Data Scientist & Machine Learning engineer who is passionate about using analytics to peform magic, contributing to open-source, and building Machine Learning community in Nigeria. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Plotly, Seaborn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Python, Gradio, Streamlit, and Flask. I combine my knowledge of Statistics, Business Development, and Data Science to build data driven projects/products that can solve problems.

My interest in the ML ecosystem led me to becoming one of the co-pilots at <a href="https://twitter.com/mlspace_co/">MLSpace</a>, an active Machine Learning community on Discord with over 11000 members.
