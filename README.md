I'm a Data Scientist & Machine Learning engineer passionate about contributing to open-source and building Machine Learning community in Nigeria. I enjoy working with technologies like Plotly, Seaborn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Python, Gradio, Streamlit, and Flask. I combine my knowledge of Statistics, Business Development, and Data Science to build data-driven projects/products that can solve problems.

My interest in the ML ecosystem led me to become one of the co-pilots / community manager at <a href="https://twitter.com/mlspace_co/">MLSpace</a>; an active Machine Learning community on Discord with over 11000 members, a Staff at [Python Discord](https://PythonDiscord.com), the biggest Python Community in the world.
